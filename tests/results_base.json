    "How do I restart the level?": "To restart the game level, typically press the \"Restart Level\" button or option on your device's control panel or menu. This action usually brings you back to the start of that particular level from where play was interrupted.",
    "How often are frames sent to the model?": "Frames are typically sent to the model every few milliseconds based on the complexity of the task and computational resources available. The frequency can vary depending on the hardware capabilities and the specific use case.",
    "How can I see the agent\u2019s run?": "To view an agent's run, you would typically need access to the system where the agent runs and has visibility into its logs or performance data. This could be through monitoring tools that interface with the agent, such as those provided by the vendor of the software or service being managed by the agent. If you're trying to troubleshoot or understand how the agent operates, consulting the documentation for the specific product or service you're using can provide detailed information on how to monitor and track agent activity.",
    "What\u2019s the last checkpoint reached?": "I'm sorry, but I need more context to answer your question about \"the last checkpoint reached.\" Could you please provide some additional information or clarify what specific situation you're referring to?",
    "Can I see the last frame buffer?": "I'm sorry, but as an AI, I can't directly access your screen or monitor. However, if you're using a computer, you might be able to view the last frame buffer by looking at the system's log files, which could contain information about recent events and updates on the display. You may need to consult your operating system documentation for specific instructions on accessing these logs.",
    "Is the model overfitting to the start?": "It seems your question refers to whether the model might be learning too much from the initial data and not generalizing well to new, unseen data. This can indeed happen when training data is insufficiently diverse or if there's an imbalance between different classes of data. To diagnose this issue, you could use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that the model performs consistently on separate datasets and consider adjusting hyperparameters for better performance.",
    "How many frames were used last episode?": "I'm sorry, but I can't provide that information as I don't have access to specific details about the current episode being discussed. To get accurate and up-to-date information, you would need to refer to the latest episode guide or synopsis for that particular show.",
    "How do I test the model on a new level?": "To test your model on a new level, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a New Test Data Set**: Select a set of data that represents a different scenario from what was used during training.\n\n2. **Prepare Your Model for Testing**: Ensure your model is trained and ready for prediction on unseen data. This might involve loading the correct weights if they were saved after training.\n\n3. **Run Predictions**: Use your model to make predictions on the new test dataset. This typically involves calling an appropriate method (like `predict()` or similar) on the model object.\n\n4. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess how well your model performs on",
    "Can I control jump duration?": "Yes, you can control the jump duration by adjusting your character's properties within the game settings. This allows for more precise control over how long you stay airborne after jumping.",
    "What\u2019s the state format for jump actions?": "In video games and similar applications, jump actions typically have specific states that represent different phases of the action. These states help manage timing and transitions between different jumps, such as air time, landing, and post-jump animation. Each state might include parameters like speed, angle, and duration, allowing for smooth and realistic movement.",
    "How do I load a saved model checkpoint?": "To load a saved model checkpoint, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Model**: Import the appropriate module for your specific model (e.g., from `torchvision.models` for models like ResNet) and load the state dictionary.\n   \n   ```python\n   import torch\n   model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Load the State Dictionary**: Load the state dictionary from the saved file.\n\n   ```python\n   checkpoint = torch.load('path_to_your_checkpoint.pth')\n   model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Parameters to"
