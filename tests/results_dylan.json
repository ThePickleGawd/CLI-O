This means that massive objects cause a distortion in the fabric of spacetime around them, and other objects move along these curves due to their motion relative to those masses. General relativity has been extensively tested through various experiments and observations, including measurements of light deflection, the bending of starlight near the sun during total solar eclipses,",

The overall equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Carbon Dioxide + Water} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose + Oxygen} \\]\n\nThis process plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth as it forms the basis of the food web and provides most of the oxygen in our atmosphere.",
    "What is evolution?": "Evolution is the process by which species change over time through the inheritance of genetic variations among their members.

This leads to changes in the traits of populations over generations, resulting in new species forming or existing ones evolving into different forms. Evolutionary theory has been supported by extensive evidence from various fields including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy."
